Solution explenation:

- Classes for each type of of product was created in order to solve shipoing logic.
- Each class created has the hability to call it's respective `shipping label` creator class
  in order to notify any special need of the product.
- Since tracking processes it's essential to determine problems, attributes were
  added to `OrderItem` class.
- I could not fin a way to remove `switch` method using Dependency injection due
  to metaprogramming restriction.

  Thanks. :)
