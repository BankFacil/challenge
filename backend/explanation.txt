Explanation:

The first change was to separate the different products into business classes (Membership, Digital, Physical and Book). 
This allows the individual logic of the different types to be created independently of the form of payment and 
the logic associated with it.

The second change was to create an "interface" of connection between the business logic and the different types of product. 
To do this, use the existing product class, change the implementation and generate the abstract methods 
that should implement the derived classes.

Finally, update the methods of existing business logic to make the call of the new methods. This change was quite small and 
can be seen in the pay method of the Payment class.

This redistribution of the different products allows creating new classes of products deriving from the "interface" Product 
without affecting the business logic created, promoting the reuse and standardization.
