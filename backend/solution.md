# Solution to the challenge

---
I created another class to handle the coordination of shippings, so instead of making a lot of `ifs`
checking wich type of product is going to be shipped, the class just instantiate another object based on the kind of product.
So, when we have another kind of product, we don't need to change any other code to make it work, we just need to create the class
wich is going to handle this type of product.
